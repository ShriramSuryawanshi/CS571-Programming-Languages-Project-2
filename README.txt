2. Program Execution - 
	
	To play the game open tetris.html file in any desktop browser.
	The blocks will appear randomly at random start point.
	You can use on-screen buttons to move the block to left and right.
	Once the entire row is formed, all the rows above that row will collapse.
	Once you reach top of the canvas, the game will stop. To play again, just reload/refresh the page. ( I have preferred not to clear the canvas on completion so user can view his game status.)



3. Testing - 

	Game tested on Google Chrome (v65.0.3325) and Microsoft Edge (v41.16299) and worked fine.
	

Thank You!
